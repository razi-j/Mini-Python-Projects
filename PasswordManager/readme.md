To use this password manager, you have to 

first: Load a key/Make a key
second: Load a Password File/Make a Password File

then you may proceed to adding a password to the file or getting a password from the file.
If file or key is incorrectly loaded, the program will not work. Without a file loaded the program will not be able to save the site and password the user has inputted.

The incorrect key used at a file will mean that it will not be decrypted thus raising an error. 

This was from NeuralNine's tutorial but I will be adding different features to it.
